 	<p class="p3 style1"><span class="style10">Introduction</span><br>
  The history of Cincinnati and northern Kentucky's transit systems 
illustrates how a city and its environs evolved over time as new 
transportation technologies were introduced, refined, and ultimately 
supplanted.  By the 1850s, Cincinnati was the 6th largest city in the 
USA with a population of 115,000, just slightly beaten out by New 
Orleans, and not much smaller than Philadelphia, Boston, and Baltimore. 
 Chicago was barely on the map at the time, and Cleveland and Columbus 
were little more than large towns with populations under 20,000.  In the
 mid 19th century, Cincinnati's population was concentrated in today's 
downtown, Over-the-Rhine, and parts of the West End.  The Mill Creek 
Valley was a sparsely settled area of small farms, orchards, and 
vineyards, as were many of the hilltop communities.  With such a high 
number of people in an area of only a few square miles, the population 
density at the time was the highest in the country.  Even Manhattan 
didn't surpass the population density of Cincinnati's core neighborhoods
 until 1900.  The barriers of the Ohio River to the south, steep 
hillsides to the north and east, and the swampy, often flooded, Mill 
Creek Valley to the west prevented much outward development.  Needless 
to say, it was so crowded that people were desperate to find a way to 
move into other areas.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1"><span class="style10">Horsecars and Early Companies</span><br>
The omnibus was the first attempt at any meaningful public 
transportation.  It was, however, little more than a glorified 
stagecoach. Since most of the streets  were just dirt, in anything but 
perfect conditions the omnibuses were so slow and unreliable that it was
  faster to just walk.  It wasn't until steel rails were perfected in 
the late 1850s that the situation started to improve.  With smooth  
rails, a carriage with steel wheels could be pulled by a team of horses 
or mules much more easily than  the previous omnibuses.  Starting on 
September 14, 1859, horsecar lines began to spread out from downtown to 
the east, west, and northwest.  That first line was opened by the 
Cincinnati Street Railroad Company (not to be confused with the later 
Cincinnati Street Railway Company) from 4th and Walnut on a single-track
 loop to the West End and back to downtown.  At the time, just about 
every horsec<span class="style14"></span>ar line was operated by a 
separate company.  Some of those companies were, along with the 
aforementioned Cincinnati Street Railroad Company, the City Passenger 
Railroad Company, the Passenger Railroad Company of Cincinnati, the 
Pendleton &amp; 5th Street Market Space Street Passenger Railroad 
Company, the Pendleton Street Railroad, and the Route Nine Street 
Railroad Company. </p>

</table>

<p class="p3 style1">The first horsecar line in Northern Kentucky, the 
Covington Street Railway Company, was incorporated in 1864  to build a 
line on Madison Avenue and across the new Suspension Bridge when it was 
completed. By the late 1870s horsecars stretched along Madison, Scott, 
3rd, 4th, Main, and Pike in Covington, with a tangle of different tracks
 circling the blocks near the approach to the Suspension Bridge. These 
were split about evenly between the original Covington Street Railway 
and the South Covington &amp; Cincinnati Street Railway Company. The 
Newport Street Railway also began operations in 1867, with a large loop 
between the riverfront and 11th Street via York and Washington. These 
horsecars used the 4th Street bridge over the Licking River to access 
the Suspension Bridge to Cincinnati. A more direct connection to 
Cincinnati was made in the late 1870s with the opening of the Newport 
&amp; Cincinnati (L&amp;N) Bridge. The Newport and Dayton Street Railway
 also operated a line along Front and Fairfield from the L&amp;N Bridge 
east into Dayton. The early companies and operations of horsecar lines 
in Northern Kentucky were very similar to those in Cincinnati, with the 
added complexity of dealing with many different municipalities, county 
governments, bridge companies, and interstate commerce laws.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">In 1873  a handful of the Cincinnati lines were 
brought under control of the Cincinnati Consolidated Railway, though 
there were still several other companies operating.  In 1879 new 
legislation attempted to define and standardize many of the operational 
procedures of the various companies.  This specified responsibility for 
road maintenance, rules for operation, and performance requirements.  
The year 1880 also saw the birth of the Cincinnati Street Railway 
Company.  The Cincinnati Consolidated Railway merged with a number of 
other lines, mostly on the west side of the city, into the new company. 
 It was at this time that Cincinnati's peculiar rail gauge came into 
being as well.  There was a great deal of apprehension about letting the
 steam railroads come into the central part of the city.  The large 
locomotives with fast spinning wheels, pistons, steam vents, smoke, and 
loud noises would scare nearby horses, injuring and even killing people 
in the panic.  With many new railroads coming into the city in the 
1850s, the horsecar companies  built their lines to a different gauge 
than the steam railroads.  They generally used either 5'-2" or 5'-3" to 
fall between the standard gauge of 4'-8 1/2" most railroads used and the
 wide gauge 6'-0" tracks of the <a href="om.html" target="_blank">Ohio &amp; Mississippi</a> and <a href="chd.html" target="_blank">CH&amp;D</a>
 (which used dual gauge tracks).  Later in the 19th century as the 
various street railway companies consolidated, they standardized on a 
5'-2 1/2" gauge that could be used by the existing 5'-2" and 5'-3" 
equipment with little or no alterations. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">Even with the steel rails, the area's hills were 
still pretty much unscalable, since horses simply couldn't pull a loaded
 car up the slopes efficiently.  Nevertheless, flat areas were opened up
 as much as possible.  Horsecar lines extended along Eastern Avenue to 
Pendleton and north on Spring Grove Avenue through Cumminsville. There 
was a fairly extensive web of lines through downtown and the West End, 
as well is in Covington and Newport.  Through the 1870s and 1880s the 
number of horsecar lines expanded into some of the hilltop communities 
like Mt. Auburn, Walnut Hills, and Price Hill, though service to those 
areas needed more than just horse power to make it viable for most 
commuters.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1"><span class="style10">Inclined Plane Railways</span></p>

<p class="p3 style1">The 1870s saw the construction of four of 
Cincinnati's five inclined plane railways.  Using a steam engine (later 
converted to electric motors in some cases) and counterbalanced 
platforms on opposing inclined tracks, they allowed people, wagons, 
horses, and later electric streetcars and buses to climb the hillsides 
almost effortlessly.  Upon reaching the top, where short-lived resort 
and overlook buildings were constructed, people could walk to their 
homes or catch another horsecar line to traverse the relatively flat 
terrain on top of the hills.  Nonetheless, it could still be a 
time-consuming journey, requiring transfers from horsecar to incline to 
another horsecar. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">All the inclines operated in slightly different 
ways over the years, each with their own idiosyncrasies.  The first 
incline built was the Mt. Auburn, or Main Street Incline, opened in 
1872.  It was unusual in that it did not have a consistent slope, being 
much steeper at the bottom than at the top.  It originally had enclosed 
cars for hauling passengers, though they were later changed to open 
platforms to haul electric streetcars.  A fatal accident occurred in 
1889 when a car reached the top of the incline, failed to stop, and the 
cable was ripped out, causing the car to slide back down to the bottom 
of the hill out of control.  All but one passenger were killed, and the 
stigma of this wreck never really wore off.  The incline was the first 
to be abandoned in 1898.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp; </p>

<p class="p3 style1">The Price Hill Incline was the second to be built 
in 1874 with two enclosed passenger cars similar to the Mt. Auburn 
Incline.  Two years later, a second set of tracks were built with open 
platforms to haul wagons.  This is the one incline that was never 
purchased by the street railway, and thus it never hauled streetcars on 
either  the passenger or freight side.  The freight plane lasted until 
1929, having hauled some private motor buses up and down the hill.  
Passenger traffic actually increased through the 1930s and it hit a high
 in the last year of full operation in 1942, though it was only about a 
third of its maximum which was seen in the late 1890s.  The incline's 
poor condition and huge expense at making necessary repairs is what 
ultimately shut it down completely in 1943. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">1876 saw the opening of the Bellevue Incline to 
foot traffic, and presumably wagons as well.  The platforms were rebuilt
 to haul electric streetcars in 1890, with enough room left over for one
 or two wagons and pedestrians as well.  The Bellevue Incline was 
abandoned in 1926, though carbarns at the top of the hill remained, and 
the streetcar line on Ohio Avenue was incorporated into a different 
route. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">1876 was also the year the Mt. Adams incline opened
 with enclosed passenger cars.  In 1879 they were converted to open 
platforms to haul horsecars.  Eventually electric streetcars were 
brought up the hill on it, and for less than a year before it was 
abandoned in 1948 a motor bus route used it.  This was the longest-lived
 of the five inclines. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The Fairview Incline was built much later than all 
the others, in 1892, by the Cincinnati Street Railway Company to serve 
their new crosstown line. At this time McMillan Street ended at Fairview
 and Ravine, so there was no other way for streetcars to get down the 
hill to connect with McMicken.  The incline was deemed unsafe for 
streetcars in 1921 and enclosed car bodies were mounted on the platforms
 for pedestrians, an interesting reversal of the usual trend.  This made
 the crosstown line excessively inconvenient, and instead of fixing the 
incline the street railway company built the extension of McMillan 
Street down the hill in 1923, at which point the incline was closed.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1"><span class="style10">Cable Cars</span><br>
  Hilltop development was spurred by the inclines, but it didn't spread 
too far past the crest of the hills.  It wasn't until the introduction 
of cable cars that reliable transportation between the hilltops and the 
heart of downtown allowed neighborhoods like Walnut Hills, Mt. Auburn, 
Corryville, and Clifton to develop significantly.  Cincinnati had three 
cable car routes, though what would have been the first in the city on 
Spring Grove Avenue was blocked in court by fear of competition with 
existing horsecar lines. </p>

</table>

<p class="p3 style1">The first to actually get built was the Walnut 
Hills Cable Railroad.  In 1872, a horsecar line was chartered to built 
up Gilbert Avenue (called Route 10) by the Walnut Hills &amp; Cincinnati
 Street Railroad Company.  This line  became a competitor to the Mt. 
Adams Incline, though it was not particularly successful, as it took the
 horsecars 30 minutes to climb the hill on Gilbert Avenue.  Originally 
proposed by John Kilgour of the Cincinnati Street Railway Company, the 
cable car line was built by George Kerper, owner of the Mt. Adams 
Incline, after buying Route 10 from Kilgour, with plans for a merger of 
the two companies in the future.  Limited service began on July 17, 
1885.  At that time, horsecars were brought to the bottom of the hill 
and the horses were unhitched,  a detachable cable grip was attached to 
make the climb, then horses took over again at the top of the hill at 
the power house which remains today opposite Sinton Avenue and Windsor 
Street.  This clumsy situation was remedied by October 1, 1886 after 
extension south to Broadway and north to Woodburn Avenues.  Once 
completed in 1887, a loop was made from Broadway to 6th to Walnut to 5th
 and back to Broadway, with the outer end of the line terminating on a 
turntable at Woodburn and Hewitt, abandoned a year later in 1888 for a 
loop at Blair and Montgomery a few blocks further north.  The carbarns 
were on Hewitt Avenue just east of Montgomery Road, but it is now gone. 
 The line was converted to electric operation in 1898, though portions 
of the line had wires over it to provide a through route for electric 
cars to Norwood starting in 1889.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The second cable car line in Cincinnati was the Mt.
 Auburn Cable Railway, chartered in 1886 and presumably completed in 
1887.  The route between 4th and Sycamore and a terminal at Reading Road
 near Rockdale had simple crossover switches at each end, as 
double-ended cars were used and didn't need turning around.  Trailers 
were used for most passengers however, and these needed to be shuffled 
around by hand at the ends of the line.  They also operated a branch 
between 1888 and 1892 from Burnett Avenue along Erkenbrecher to serve 
the Cincinnati Zoo with a special steam dummy car.  The power house and 
barns at the corner of Highland and Dorchester caught fire in 1892 and 
was rebuilt. The building has sat empty for decades, and  on February 
22, 2021 the roof collapsed, reportedly due to heavy snow accumulation, 
and demolition of the remaining building started on February 27.  
Consolidation in 1896 brought the line under the control of the 
Cincinnati Street Railway Company, and it operated until June 9, 1902.  
The Sycamore Street hill was too steep for electric cars to traverse 
however, so the rails were abandoned between Milton Street and Auburn 
Avenue in favor of an easier route up Liberty Hill and Milton to 
Highland Avenue. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The final cable car line built in Cincinnati was 
the Vine Street Cable Railway, opened in 1887 between Fountain Square 
and the company's carbarn and power house at Vine and Rochelle in 
Corryville.  In 1888 the line was extended to a loop at Ludlow, 
Middleton, Bryant, and Telford in Clifton, though it was operated as a 
branch, so passengers had to change cars at Corryville.  In early 1893 
the cars from Clifton were run through to downtown, requiring a 
momentum-assisted coast across the cable change next to the power house.
  All three cable roads had to do this, and sometimes there wasn't 
enough momentum to cross the gap, requiring the motorman to push the car
 by hand.  The power house and carbarns remained until the 1980s or 90s,
 used in the later years as studio space for UC's design school.  The 
central utility plant now occupies the site, and Jefferson Avenue 
between Vine and Nixon was removed for the EPA building.  This cable 
road was converted to electricity in 1898.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">While their 8-10 MPH speed isn't impressive by 
today's standards, it tripled the distance people could live from the 
center of town.  Being pulled by a cable from a central plant meant that
 hills were of no consequence.  This is the main reason they still exist
 in San Francisco to this day.  Nonetheless, they were very expensive to
 maintain in working order.  The cables only lasted six to nine months, 
and it was difficult to keep debris out of the guideways.  New cables 
would take a full weekend to replace, and they would stretch 
significantly after being put into service, by many tens of feet.  In 
some instances, this stretched cable would bunch up and could snag a 
car's grip, causing it to run out of control.  Also, most corners and  
crossovers were unpowered, with the cable running into a protected 
guideway and series of pulleys.  The car's gripman would have to let go 
of the cable and coast to a place where he could get a new grip.  A lack
 of momentum could strand the car, requiring it to be pushed by hand.  
Failure to let go of the cable could break the grip, or damage the cable
 and guideway.  It's no wonder that electric streetcars came to dominate
 so quickly.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1"><span class="style10">Steam Dummies</span><br>
  Before moving on to electric streetcars, mention has to be made of a  
short-lived and somewhat obscure method of transportation, the steam 
dummy. It was basically a small railroad locomotive built to look like a
 trolley car, so it wouldn't scare horses like a normal railroad 
locomotive might. They generally weren't successful in that regard, and 
were prone to frequent breakdowns and complaints due to smoke and noise.
 Mention has already been made of the steam dummy branch line operated 
by the Mt. Auburn Cable Railway. It opened in 1888 and ran from Burnett 
Avenue west along Erkenbrecher to serve the Cincinnati Zoo.  This was a 
sort of hybrid steam dummy cable car. There was still a cable slot 
between the rails, but the cable was fixed at each end, and the steam 
engine operated a pulley in the car which engaged the cable to drive it.
  This peculiar system lasted only  four years until 1892 when the city 
repaved the road and tore up the rails, not allowing the railway company
 to restore them.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The other steam dummy line in the city was located 
in the East End and Mt. Lookout.  It is much better known than the very 
short-lived dummy on Erkenbrecher, and it was a bit more conventional 
since it didn't need to use pulleys to engage a cable.  The project was 
the brainchild of John Kilgour's brother Charles, secretary of the 
Little Miami Railroad.  He built the Pendleton &amp; Fifth Street Market
 Space Street Railroad running from Fountain Square into Fulton via 
Eastern Avenue in 1860.  It was extended to the west edge of Pendleton 
in 1863, at what is today St. Andrews Street.  Being a few miles long 
already, it wasn't possible to extend the line much farther using horse 
power.  Extension was needed though, as there was already an established
 community in Columbia, and new estate development in Mt. Lookout where 
the Kilgours had built a house.  The Little Miami Railroad provided 
infrequent and expensive service unsuitable for commuting, so the 
decision was made to extend the horsecar line with a steam dummy. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The Cincinnati &amp; Columbia Street Railroad was 
chartered on December 5, 1863 to build a single track route from the end
 of the existing horsecar line at St. Andrews Street on Eastern Avenue 
to Carrell Street, with a passing siding near Delta Avenue.  They used a
 5'-2 1/2" gauge, and opened for regular service on June 24, 1866.  
While traffic was light, and they still had trouble with frightened 
horses, the Kilgours wanted to develop their extensive real estate 
holdings in Mt. Lookout.  On March 14, 1871, they received permission to
 build a branch up Crawfish Road, today's Delta Avenue, to Erie Avenue. 
 This branch was built with 3'-0" narrow gauge tracks (and the existing 
line on Eastern Avenue was converted to match) on an alignment 
significantly different from today's Delta Avenue.  The original 
Crawfish Road was much more twisty and narrow, with many undulations 
that were smoothed out and bypassed later on.  It was much like Clough 
Pike is today, and a lot of the valley has been subsequently filled to 
bring the grade up to a more manageable level, and to give a little more
 room to build on either side.  Little of the old street remains, except
 for the lower part of Empress Avenue, which appears to be the original 
road.  The dummy branch had to be built off to the side of the old road 
on its own right of way, but because the now gone Crawfish Creek's 
valley was so much deeper than today, the dummy line still had to 
contend with some very steep grades.  The branch was completed to Mt. 
Lookout Square in July 1872 and operations began, while final completion
 to Erie Avenue didn't happen until 11 months later. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">As the neighborhoods developed, little news of the 
steam dummy was reported.  However, by 1886 there were rumblings from 
the community to replace the unsatisfactory service with cable cars.  
Little investment was made in the dummy line since it was primarily a 
venue to increase real estate prices and attractiveness for the 
Kilgour's land, much like other suburban railroads.  Nonetheless,    the
 East End line was purchased by the Cincinnati Street Railway, upgraded 
to electric operation, and converted back to broad gauge tracks by 1891.
 The Mt. Lookout branch was left to flounder with the steam dummy cars a
 while longer.  In 1896 it was finally brought into the Cincinnati 
Street Railway Company, and it was viewed as a good link between the 
East End car line and the Erie Avenue car line which had opened in 1894 
and terminated at a loop next to Delta Avenue at what was then St. 
John's Park.  Abandonment was delayed until 1897 when re-grading of 
Delta Avenue was completed and tracks could be laid in the new road. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">One last very obscure steam dummy was operated by 
the Newport and Dayton Street Railway in Kentucky. The company 
experimented with two cars that were run from October 22, 1877 to 
February 2, 1878. At that date Newport filed a court order banning the 
contraptions which they deemed a nuisance. The company tried hitching 
horses to them but this was deemed impractical and the line reverted to 
horsecars. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1"><span class="style12"><strong>Electric Streetcars</strong></span><br>
  In 1888, just after the cable car lines were completed, the first 
electric streetcar service began in Cincinnati.  It was done by George 
Kerper's Mt. Adams &amp; Eden Park Inclined Railway Company, owner of 
the Mt. Adams Incline and the Walnut Hills Cable Railroad.  This company
 electrified their horsecar line on McMillan Street from Gilbert Avenue 
to Oak Street and Reading Road.  Later that year, Kerper received 
permission to build a line to the B&amp;O Railroad in the middle of 
Norwood.  There never were horsecars in Norwood, so this was the first 
brand new all-electric line, extended along Montgomery Road from the end
 of the Walnut Hills Cable Railroad's terminal loop at Blair Avenue in 
Evanston.  This route came from downtown up the Mt. Adams Incline, 
through Eden Park to Nassau, then followed Gilbert to Montgomery, 
running over the cable car tracks from Nassau to McMillan, and between 
Gilbert/Hewitt and Blair in Evanston. The first electric route in 
Covington was the Madison Avenue line, which operated as a shuttle 
starting in 1890 until negotiations were settled with the Suspension 
Bridge owners and Cincinnati to install wires to Fountain Square early 
in 1891.</p>

</table>

<p class="p3 style1">These earliest cars had a single large trolley pole
 but collected power from two closely spaced wires.  It didn't take long
 for the wires to be spread farther apart to prevent short circuiting, 
and two separate trolley poles were used.  This early setup was likely 
due to the horsecar era rails not being electrically bonded, so they 
couldn't be used for the return current.  Attempts to do so by the 
Cincinnati Inclined Plane Railway Company, owner of the Mt. Auburn 
Incline, caused the telephone company to file a lawsuit in 1890 to 
prevent the street railway companies from using rail returns, saying 
current leakage caused static on their underground phone lines.  There 
were also restrictions on digging up streets, so properly bonding 
existing horsecar or cable car tracks wasn't always possible.  The 
effects of current leakage are well documented, and they can accelerate 
corrosion of underground conduits and piping due to electrolytic 
reactions.  Even new systems can have this problem, and there were 
issues in Salt Lake City with increased corrosion of water mains near a 
new light rail line. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">An injunction required that only dual overhead 
wires could be used within the city limits until a ruling in the trial. 
 The case dragged on, and even though the street railway eventually won,
 by then so much dual overhead had been installed that it became the 
standard for the system.  With the presence of the dual wiring, the 
rails were not bonded electrically, so interurbans operating over the 
street railway had to be equipped with double trolley poles, though they
 only used them when on street railway trackage.  Some interurbans like 
the IR&amp;T used dual overhead within the city limits even on their own
 tracks, while others used single overhead, only switching when they 
came onto the street railway tracks, such as the CG&amp;P.  Even street 
railway cars would use single overhead outside the city limits, such as 
on route 78 to Lockland, which would take down the second pole upon 
entering St. Bernard.  Though Carthage and Hartwell, through which route
 78 ran, were annexed in 1911 and 1912 respectively, they kept single 
overhead since it was already setup that way beforehand. The Northern 
Kentucky lines were also affected by this, with dual overhead on the 
bridges over the Ohio River, and most streetcars putting up or taking 
down the second pole  on the Kentucky side of the river.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">While Cincinnati was the only major city in the 
United States to operate dual overhead wiring for streetcars, the rest 
of the electrical infrastructure was pretty typical.  The first power 
plants were located along with carbarns in Brighton on Harrison Avenue, 
Mt. Auburn on Reading Road, and Pendleton (East End) on Eastern Avenue. 
 The streetcars themselves were powered with 600 volt DC current, though
 since DC current can only travel a few miles, substations connected by 
high voltage AC transmission lines were built throughout the city and 
surrounding areas to make sure enough power was available.  Early 
substation were located at each of the three power stations, as well as 
in Lower Price Hill, Price Hill, Over-the-Rhine, Cumminsville, Evanston,
 Hartwell, and East Hyde Park. The Kentucky lines ran on 550 volts DC, 
though they could operate just fine over the tracks of the Cincinnati 
Street Railway. The company's main power plant was in Newport along with
 their  barns and shops near 11th Street and the Licking River.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The Mt. Adams &amp; Eden Park Inclined Railway 
Company expanded their electric operations throughout the remainder of 
the 1880s and early 1890s.  Kerper resigned in 1890, but work continued 
under new management and a new line on Madison Road to Hyde Park was 
built.  In 1893, a joint venture with the Cincinnati Street Railway 
Company saw construction on McMillan Street between Gilbert and Ohio 
Avenues.  The company finally became a part of the Cincinnati Street 
Railway Company in 1896.  Even before acquiring the Mt. Adams company, 
the Cincinnati Street Railway was already the largest operator in the 
city.  After seeing the success of Kerper's first electric line, they 
electrified their Colerain Avenue route to Cumminsville in 1889, and 
they bought the East End line through Pendleton on Eastern Avenue to 
Columbia at Carrell Street in the same year with plans to electrify it. 
 Conversion was completed in 1891 as mentioned earlier.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">This was also a busy time for expansion of the 
Northern Kentucky system as well. After the typical mergers and 
acquisitions, the dominant company was the Cincinnati, Newport and 
Covington Railway, also known as the Green Line due to its paint scheme.
 The early 1890s saw extensions being opened to southern parts of 
Covington, specifically to Rosedale and Latonia. The long line to Ft. 
Thomas also opened in 1893 as was the line to Ludlow and Bromley. The 
route to Evergreen Cemetery in Southgate was also opened in 1894. 
Opening of the Central Bridge in 1890 allowed some of the Newport routes
 to be directed over that bridge to reduce congestion and running time 
over the nearby L&amp;N Bridge. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">1896 is a year that has been mentioned a number of 
times already, as it was the date of final consolidation of all the 
disparate companies into the Cincinnati Street Railway.  The only parts 
not consolidated were the lines in northern Kentucky, and the Vine 
Street line north of the zoo, which went to John Kilgour personally, as 
it was to be part of his Millcreek Valley Line (the <a href="ch.html" target="_blank">Cincinnati &amp; Hamilton</a>
 interurban).  In 1901 the Cincinnati Street Railway leased all of its 
property to the Cincinnati Traction Company to operate and maintain all 
the lines.  This was done to retire outstanding mortgage bonds and 
increase the capital stock available to the system.  1902 saw the first 
double-truck cars on the system, though some single-truck cars were 
still ordered a few years later due to their reduced power requirements,
 as the electrical system was over capacity.  The rails themselves were 
nearly at capacity as well, and traffic jams were a serious problem 
around Fountain Square, which every line that came downtown passed.  
More and more cars were ordered, and electrical capacity was increased 
while some routes were shifted a block or so away from Fountain Square 
to reduce congestion. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">In the waning years of the 19th Century and the 
first ten years of the 20th, the street railway system was mostly built 
out.  The three branches in Norwood were built at this time, as well as 
extension along Montgomery to Fenwick.  Lines were extended up Elberon 
and out Glenway and Warsaw, shutting down the last horsecar line in the 
city, the Price Hill Jerky, which operated from the top of the Price 
Hill Incline to Hawthorne and Warsaw until 1904.  More lines were 
extended to Madisonville and Oakley, as well as to Cheviot, College 
Hill, and Lockland.  This is also the time many interurbans started 
operation, and some of their tracks eventually became extensions of 
existing streetcar lines that they fed into. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The last major new route in Kentucky, the line to 
Ft. Mitchell, was also opened in 1902. The first section only went as 
far as Lewisburg, with an extension in 1903 to Highland and St. Mary's 
Cemeteries, and final completion to Orphanage Road happening in 1910. A 
new loop of tracks through south Bellevue also opened in 1904. In 1907 
the Columbia Gas and Electric company also purchased the Cincinnati, 
Newport and Covington Light and Traction Company, then owner of the 
Green Line, to get control of the electric and gas franchises and 
facilities. They couldn't buy only the gas and electric portion, so they
 somewhat begrudgingly took on the Green Line as well. This actually 
proved to be a huge boon for the Green Line, since it had the financial 
backing of a fast growing utility company to underwrite any potential 
losses for the traction business. While this relationship was ultimately
 doomed by the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the breakup 
didn't happen until just after World War II. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">1910 also saw the incorporation of the Newport and 
Alexandria Interurban Electric Railway Company, whose purpose was to 
build an interurban to Alexandria from the end of the Ft. Thomas Line 
and to operate over it to reach Cincinnati. Various difficulties stalled
 right-of-way acquisition until 1916,  and   growing doubts about the 
future of the industry, on top of entering World War I, had dried up the
 capital of the company. By 1918 only 1.3 miles of track had been built,
 and the Green Line acquired it for salvage value and operated it as a 
shuttle. The short extension lasted only until 1924 before it was 
abandoned. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The 1910s and 20s saw little additional 
construction of new lines compared to previous decades.  Existing lines 
were extended, such as adding track along Glenway to Ferguson, or taking
 over part of the IR&amp;T on Montgomery from Fenwick to the city limits
 at Coleridge, and various minor connections were made such as the 
completion of McMillan Street down the hill to connect with McMicken.  
1916 saw the opening of the last completely new streetcar line in 
Cincinnati, Route 42 to Bond Hill via Paddock Road.  Unable to reach the
 heart of Bond Hill due to a new law prohibiting streetcars from 
crossing railroads at grade, it never saw great patronage, especially 
for passing through essentially unsettled areas around the Avon Field 
golf course.  A motor bus line was started in 1926 along Paddock Road to
 Lockland, providing easier access than the streetcar.  Grade separation
 of the B&amp;O Railroad crossing on Paddock in 1927 only served to 
destroy the turnaround loop for the line, and it wasn't repaired.  
Instead they used a double-ended jerky car until 1928 when 
reconstruction of Reading Road severed the connection to the rest of the
 system, and this last streetcar line to be opened was also the first in
 Cincinnati to be replaced with motor buses. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">The 1910s also saw some abandonments in Kentucky. 
In 1917 the city of Newport decided to repave Patterson Street with 
asphalt to make it better for car and truck traffic, and they tore up 
the streetcar tracks in the process. They told the street railway 
company to put back their tracks and repave the rest of the road, but 
they refused, arguing that the tracks and the road were fine before. 
Newport did not prevail in the ensuing legal battle since they violated 
the franchise agreement, and Patterson Street lost transit service until
 buses were introduced in 1936. There was also complaining among the 
merchants on Monmouth Street that  streetcars were blocking automobile 
traffic, so they successfully campaigned to have the tracks removed 
between 5th and 11th Streets and to divert the remaining service to 
existing tracks on York, just one block away. The store owners would 
come to regret that decision as they lost much more foot traffic than 
they gained from automobiles. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The most significant project during this time 
period was the construction of Dixie Terminal, which opened in 1921. 
This office building and streetcar terminal, which still exists at the 
corner of 4th and Walnut, greatly reduced travel times for Kentucky 
streetcars by consolidating all their terminal operations into one 
building.  Covington cars entered the upper level of the terminal from 
the Suspension Bridge by dedicated viaducts over 3rd Street. Newport 
cars used the lower level which they accessed from 3rd Street after 
crossing the Central Bridge to Broadway Street. This new facility 
removed all the Kentucky cars from the already horribly congested  4th 
and 5th Streets and Fountain Square, saving 5-10 minutes of running 
time. At this same time the Green Line also stopped using the L&amp;N 
Bridge and routed all their Newport division cars over the Central 
Bridge. This shortened the distance to Dixie Terminal, saving  the 
rental fees, maintenance, and traffic bottlenecks on the L&amp;N Bridge.
 </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The mid 1920s saw a significant investment being 
poured into the street railway in Cincinnati, despite the lack of any 
significant extensions.  Many streets and their tracks were completely 
rebuilt, including Hamilton, Erie, Madison, and Delta Avenues, among 
many others.  There was also a big move to improve the electrical system
 as well.  The East End/Pendleton power station and barns were closed, 
and extra power as needed was bought wholesale from the electric 
company.  This move also saw the building of many new fully automatic 
substations and upgrading of a few older ones, since traffic was 
increasing and the newer cars were bigger, heavier, and drew much more 
power than early electrics.  New substations were built in the West End 
near Union Terminal, in Westwood, Camp Washington, Winton Place, Elmwood
 Place, O'Bryonville, and Columbia-Tusculum. The Green Line in Kentucky 
also phased out their own power generating facilities around this time 
as they were becoming outmoded. The Newport power house was gradually 
relegated to a substation as the new West End power station in 
Cincinnati was brought online between 1918 and 1923. Other substations 
for the northern Kentucky routes were at Stewart and Madison in 
Covington, 35th and Decoursey in Latonia, and on Dixie Highway near 
today's I-75 interchange. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1"><span class="style12"><strong>The Cincinnati Subway</strong></span><br>
  The 1920s, was also the time of the ill-fated Cincinnati subway. The 
Cincinnati Street Railway was contracted to operate it so it deserves 
mention as part of the overall history of the city's streetcars and 
transit.&nbsp; The broader history has been spun off to its own page <a href="mecanal.html" target="_blank" moz-do-not-send="true">here</a>.<br>

</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The 1930s was a time of transition for many 
street railway companies, with the Great Depression causing reduced 
ridership and putting pressure on the companies to economize and 
modernize their operations.  While Cincinnati ridership peaked near 100 
million in 1929, with about 30 million in northern Kentucky, it dropped 
by some 40% at the worst part of the Depression.  The streetcar was 
still king of operations, but the writing was on the wall.  The early 
part of the decade saw the opening of the Western Hills Viaduct in 1932 
to replace the  obsolete Harrison Avenue Viaduct just a short distance 
south.  While this new viaduct improved streetcar service to Fairmount 
and Westwood, it also greatly improved automobile access to those same 
neighborhoods.  The same was true later in the decade when Columbia 
Parkway was opened in 1938.  The East End car line got some new private 
right-of-way along the  highway, but the significantly reduced travel 
time for  motorists to East Walnut Hills, Hyde Park, Columbia-Tusculum, 
Mt. Lookout, Linwood, Fairfax, and Mariemont ultimately led to the 
collapse of all the east side streetcar lines.  For that reason, 
Columbia Parkway basically killed off Peeble's Corner, which depended on
 the high number of passengers going through there and transferring 
between lines.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">1936 saw the introduction of the first electric 
trolleybuses to Cincinnati, on the Clark Street line that traversed 
Spring Grove Avenue to  Chester Park.  The tracks on Spring Grove Avenue
 needed replacing, and the street had to be repaved.  To avoid the cost 
of renewing the tracks, the traction company decided to try out 
trolleybuses on this line.  These vehicles were an easy sell in 
Cincinnati since the dual overhead wiring needed for them was already in
 place.  Changes had to be made at  switches and crossovers, but in 
general little other modification was necessary.  They proved their 
versatility by being able to maneuver around  other vehicles while still
 remaining connected to the wires.  Being electric, they were much 
quieter than gasoline or diesel buses, and they were probably  quieter 
than the streetcars they replaced, since they had rubber wheels instead 
of steel.  The trial was successful, and a few other lines were 
converted, but the coming of World War II would temporarily halt the 
changeover of much of the system.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">At the same time, the Green Line in Kentucky was 
being decimated by private bus competition. Kentucky didn't begin 
restricting competing bus lines until much later than Ohio, so the 
effects were much more acute. The Green Line responded in part by 
introducing some of its own bus lines and extending other routes with 
buses. They also converted the 6-Rosedale and 7-Latonia routes to 
electric trolleybuses in 1937 after adding a second overhead wire. The 
main reason for this was to abandon the worn streetcar tracks on these 
heavy-haul lines, but also to retain entrance to Dixie Terminal, which 
only allowed electrically powered vehicles to enter the building. The 
3-Ludlow route was also converted to trolleybuses in 1939, and this 
would be the last electric conversion on the Kentucky side of the river.
 With the Green Line trying to outcompete other bus lines, buying out 
competitors and acquiring their vehicles, and with concerns about 
flood-prone routes that were just as troublesome for trolleybuses as for
 streetcars, northern Kentucky saw an  earlier and more gradual 
switchover to gasoline and diesel buses than Cincinnati.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">At the time the trolleybuses were being tested out,
 a new type of modern streetcar was also brought in for evaluation.  The
 sleek PCC cars, developed by a committee of street railway company 
presidents, were intended to modernize streetcar fleets across the 
country and breathe new life into the systems by using a common 
interchangeable design.  These new cars were lightweight, 
quick-accelerating, smooth,  comfortable, and they saved on electricity 
and track wear.  Three cars were ordered in 1938 for evaluation, all 
built to the new PCC specifications, but each from a different car 
company.  One was built by Pullman-Standard, another by Brilliner, and a
 third by the St. Louis Car Company.  Ultimately, the decision was made 
to go with the St. Louis cars, and several were ordered in late 1939.  
The second and last order of new PCC cars came in July 1945, only 6 
years before the system was abandoned, when the remaining PCC cars were 
sold to Toronto. PCC cars were not operated on the Kentucky lines, which
 used many old streetcars, even single truck ones, until the very end.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">Despite how well received the PCC streetcars were, 
the priority in the 1940s was to make more room for automobiles.  The 
streetcars ran down the middle of the streets, and their station 
platforms were considered obstacles to automobile traffic flow.  While 
World War II put a halt to some plans to convert lines to trolleybus or 
motor bus because of rubber tire and gasoline rationing, once the war 
was over conversion happened swiftly.  After the war, most of the street
 railway system was still in use, and there was even some track 
rehabilitation done in 1946.  Nonetheless, starting in 1947 there was a 
big push to convert routes to trolleybuses, and the last few streetcar 
lines were abandoned on April 29, 1951.  Of those last routes, all were 
converted to trolleybus except one, Route 78 to Lockland. The longest 
and one of the busiest lines in the system, it was replaced with diesel 
buses.  So while that was the last streetcar line closed, it also marked
 the end of any new trolleybus lines as well.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">Since no rail lines were operating anymore, the 
street railway company changed its name to the Cincinnati Transit 
Company.  The quiet and smooth operation of the trolleybuses couldn't 
recapture the many people leaving the city and foregoing public 
transportation however.  Ridership, which was near its 100 million per 
year peak even in the late 1940s, was dropping significantly through the
 50s.  Even without the burden of track maintenance, the electrical 
system was seen as a further area to economize, and diesel buses began 
to replace trolleybus lines.  This was a bit more gradual than the 
retiring of the streetcars, but the end of electrically powered transit 
in Cincinnati came on June 18, 1965 when Route 61, Cilfton-Ludlow was 
converted to diesel.  Several of the coaches in good condition were sold
 to Dayton, which still operates a fleet of trolleybuses today. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">With conversion to motor buses already in full 
swing in Kentucky before World War II, it didn't take long for them to 
finish the process after record wartime ridership numbers had thoroughly
 beat up the system. The Ft. Thomas route was converted to buses in 
1947, operating along Waterworks Road until the early 1950s when the old
 private right-of-way was sold off and paved as Memorial Parkway. At the
 very beginning of 1948, after conversion of 4-Main and 5-Holman in 
Covington to motor buses, only the long Ft. Mitchell streetcar line 
remained. July 2, 1950 was the last scheduled run of that line, though 
on July 3 the car "Kentucky" was brought out to Park Hills to be towed 
to the Behringer-Crawford Museum in Devou Park for display, at which 
point the electricity was turned off. Ridership crashed throughout the 
1950s, and the upcoming construction of Ft. Washington Way and I-75 was 
going to require the construction of temporary overhead to maintain 
service on the remaining trolleybus lines. To avoid that expense, on 
March 17, 1958 northern Kentucky was entirely motorized when the three 
trolleybus lines were dismantled. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">The Cincinnati and northern Kentucky systems 
struggled through the 1960s and were completely bankrupt by the 1970s. 
The now ubiquitous bus lines were still plagued with high costs from 
ever increasing employee salaries and further erosion of ridership due 
to government funded road and highway expansions. The expanded highways 
did allow for some longer-haul operations to operate fairly quickly, but
 transit service to suburban locations was and remains rather 
inefficient. The only real bright spot in the situation was the Green 
Line's service to and from the new Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky 
International Airport. They had already been running buses to there to 
carry construction workers, but overall ridership for transporting 
employees and some travelers routinely exceeded expectations. After I-75
 was built, it cut about 10 minutes off travel times, and it had become 
the one bright spot in the Green Line's failing business. Still, like 
many transit systems across the country, there was a negative feedback 
loop where ridership dropped, then fares would have to be raised and 
service   cut, thus leading to further reduced ridership and starting 
the cycle all over again.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">In 1972 the Green Line was out of business, and 
with the new availability of Federal funds, voters in Northern Kentucky 
agreed to take over the defunct system, creating the Transit Authority 
of Northern Kentucky (TANK) to keep the buses running. In 1973, the 
Cincinnati Transit Company was also out of business and absorbed into 
the new Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA), and the bus 
system was named Queen City Metro. SORTA also began operating a small 
fleet of Access buses for disabled riders who can't use the regular bus 
system. Metro abandoned the historical orange and cream color scheme for
 white and black buses with a blue and purple stripe. This has been more
 recently supplanted by a green and blue scheme on a white background 
that tries to play up the green aspects of transit. TANK buses use a 
blue and green livery that pays at least a small homage to the 
historical Green Line. While still separate organizations, SORTA and 
TANK entered into a comprehensive cooperation agreement in 1999 that 
attempts to better coordinate the two systems. While ridership numbers 
are just a small fraction of what they were in the 1920s or during World
 War II, both Metro and TANK buses continue to serve Cincinnati and 
northern Kentucky on some of the same routes as the original omnibus and
 horsecar lines of 150 years ago. </p>

<p class="p3 style1"><span class="style12"><strong>Epilogue</strong></span><br>
  For nearly 100 years, Cincinnati's growth outside the downtown basin 
was enabled by its street railway system.  From slow horsecars to cable 
cars to inclines and electric streetcars and trolleybuses, there was an 
extensive network of relatively quiet, frequent, and well-patronized 
public transit.  The cable cars and electrically powered streetcars and 
trolleybuses did not pollute the air where they ran, and they provided 
the framework for the city to grow outward.  Every neighborhood within 
the city limits, except for Mt. Airy and Roselawn, had either streetcar 
or interurban service, and all of it is gone today.  It's a risky 
proposition to dismantle a system which essentially built a whole city. 
Imagine what would happen if pedestrians were banned from downtown, or 
if automobiles were no longer allowed to operate in Indian Hill or 
Fairfield. It's no surprise then that many of our  neighborhoods are 
dysfunctional today.</p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">Road projects like Columbia Parkway diverted people
 away from important transit routes and opened up  new areas to 
sprawling development.  However, the construction of I-75, I-71, I-74, 
and the Norwood Lateral aggressively tore through already built-up 
neighborhoods.  These roads demolished hundreds of buildings, displacing
 thousands of people, and they encouraged the development of new 
neighborhoods way out on the fringe, much farther out than anyone using a
 streetcar could imagine.  Because of this, the city itself has lost 
significant population and tax revenue, and without any meaningful 
public transportation left, the whole region is choked with traffic 
while it doesn't have to be. </p>

<p class="p3 style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p3 style1">A new electric streetcar loop opened on September 
9, 2016, running from 2nd Street at The Banks to Henry Street near the 
base of Bellevue Hill in Over-the-Rhine.  It operates as a circulator 
similar to the early horsecar lines, allowing people to get around   
more quickly and supporting walkable urban neighborhood development. 
Despite some teething problems and city politicians who wanted to 
abandon it mid-construction, and who continue to do everything in their 
power to hobble the system, one hopes that it is but the first in a long
 line of better transit  so that Cincinnati, and the whole region, can 
move forward to a better future. </p>
